                        <p>In response to the Covid-19 outbreak Visualskies are mobilising
                            their full range of aerial technology and 3D expertise to help
                            circumvent some of the issues that construction industry
                            professionals are currently experiencing. Drone technology
                            enables us to remotely access sites whilst, at the same time,
                            maintaining the social distancing that is so essential to our
                            welfare at the moment.</p>

                                <p>We’re utilising our aerial fleet to promote social distancing.
                                    To do our part we’re offering free aerial remote live viewing to
                                    help ease the burden on on-site staff, allowing site owners and
                                    stakeholders to assess their site remotely without the need to
                                    send staff into an area where the infection could potentially be
                                    spread. If you have a concern regarding your site then feel free
                                    to get in <a href="mailto:hello@visitskies.com">touch</a>. We also offer a range of monitoring options to
                                    complement this service.</p>

                                <p>Aerial video/ photography can be utilised to view parts of
                                    a site which cannot be accessed by a static camera. This
                                    data capture method forms the basis of all Visualskies site
                                    monitoring services. It can be viewed either via live streaming to
                                    a smartphone or tablet, saved as a record of evidence to return
                                    to later or used to extract further data.</p>

                                <p>By utilising the latest UAV-bourne technologies including aerial
                                    LiDAR and photogrammetry, we’re able to capture large scale
                                    data assets in a manner not previously possible. Whether
                                    scanned at the project outset as the basis to model from or
                                    during the programme to use as an analysis tool, aerial scanning
                                    is fast becoming a requirement on major Building Information
                                    Modelling (BIM) projects across the UK.</p>
